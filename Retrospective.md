# Code Dojo 45 - Calculator, retrospective

Looking back on your and your partner's code, consider the following questions:

* What decisions did you make that affected the design of your solution?
* Did your solution allow for the entry of negative numbers?
* How did your solution deal with the precedence rules for arithmetical operators?
* How might your design be improved if you were to do the exercise again?
* What did you learn from looking at other pairs' solutions?

I hope you enjoyed the kata.
