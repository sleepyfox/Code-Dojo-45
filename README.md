# Code Dojo 45 - Calculator

This is the code kata from the 45th meeting of the London Code Dojo.

This is an original kata, though I'm sure not an original idea. The aim is to create a simple commmand line app that will calculate simple sums. It should support the four operations of basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The only unusual requirement is that it should work with [Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) otherwise known as Normal Polish Notation (NPN) or prefix notation - invented by the Polish logician Jan ≈Åukasiewicz in 1924.

When you've finished with this please move onto the second part, described [here](./README_2nd.md).
